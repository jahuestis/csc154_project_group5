### 1.	Project Objectives  

The primary goal of this application is to help people manage their finances, visualize spending habits, track savings accounts, and plan future investments. The main objectives include aiding in money management through utilizing visual layouts to track income and expenses. The application will implement various graphical displays such as pie charts and bar graphs to summarize spending habits. 

 

### 2. 	Project Scope 

The boundaries of the project include a web application that displays visuals related to income and expenses. The user will have the ability to input expenses and sort them into default or custom financial categories (i.e., rent, utility bills, tuition, etc.). The application accepts automatic monthly payments such as streaming service fees, insurance deductibles, etc., which can be input by the user to recur monthly. The user can set their own budget and opt in to receive email alerts informing users they’ve gone over the set estimate. There is no limit to the amount of income or expense the user can input and the application comes with a standard calculator built in to compute totals. The user will have an allotment of ten inputs for financial evaluation with the option to subscribe to the application’s subscription service for unlimited inputs. The service is $10 per month and includes more features and unlimited allotments. The application only includes US States and US currency.  

As of now, the application excludes income and expenses from retirement, child support, and under the table work. The only income to be evaluated will come from the user’s W2(or a manually entered salary amount).  

 

### 3. 	Team Collaboration and Documentation Tools  

The project will consist of using Microsoft office tools such as Word, Teams, Outlook, and PowerPoint. These tools will assist the development of the project by aiding in brainstorming, team meetings, team communication, and overall productivity. Another platform needed will be GitHub for documentation and code sharing. This open-source tool will be crucial during the developmental stage for its collaboration, version control, and backlog tracking features.    

  

### 4. 	Project Management Plan and Methodologies 

The methodology for the project is agile. This method was chosen for a number of reasons including the promotion of self-organizing teams, incremental development, and cross-functional teams. The development of the project will benefit from the agile method’s flexible and adaptable nature. Due to the team members all being in different places, the weekly sprint meetings are an effective way to work independently then come together to collaborate on tasks.   

The project’s plan will be completed on schedule and kept on track through timely weekly meetings by the members. The meetings will include a review of project priorities, problem solving issues that arise, assuming new tasks to complete, and team participation on collective efforts. The project will have set deadlines the team will meet during each sprint iteration. The documentation will consist of a weekly progress report that details a summation of the week’s events.
