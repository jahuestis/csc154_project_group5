## Project Management Plan and Methodologies 
- Describe how your group will use these project management methods and tools during this project development. 

    - Agile methodologies  

        - Self-organizing teams 

        - Customer Communication  

        - Incremental Development 

        - Cross-functional teams 

        - High quality product 

    - Weekly Sprint Meetings 

        - Collaborate and communicate with team and determine tasks, outcomes, and priorities for the week 

The methodology for the project is agile. This method was chosen for a number of reasons including the promotion of self-organizing teams, incremental development, and cross-functional teams. The development of the project will benefit from the agile method’s flexible and adaptable nature. Due to the team members all being in different places, the weekly sprint meetings are an effective way to work independently then come together to collaborate on tasks.  

The project’s plan will be completed on schedule and kept on track through timely weekly meetings by the members. The meetings will include a review of project priorities, problem solving issues that arise, assuming new tasks to complete, and team participation on collective efforts. The project will have set deadlines the team will meet during each sprint iteration. The documentation will consist of a weekly progress report that details a summation of the week’s events.
